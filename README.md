### Who am I?
I'm a fresh-faced and eager software developer looking to make my mark on the world! I'm extremely passionate about being involved in work that is meaningful. Challenges don't scare me and I'm eager to continue learning, pushing the boundaries of my skills ever and ever further. 

I've previously worked in retail and healthcare sectors and also have a range of experiences volunteering for charities and youth organisations including my local Explorer Scouts. I've been drawn to and excited about purusing a career in tech because of how I can see it transform not only my life but the lives others via community led tech solutions.
